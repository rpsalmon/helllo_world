# My 100 Days of Code

## I am starting this with only self-taugh experience with SQL.

### My goal is to move from a simple data analyst with the ability to query databases and onto data sscientist and product manager
There is going to be a lot of variety day-to-day; lots of coding, IBM, Azure, AWS, Tableau, SQL, Python\

I have a long list to tackle and will try to fit it all in:
* Visualization (Tableau, Power BI)
* Networking - connecting remotely, virtual machines, cloud computing
* Command line/BASH
* Brush up on my Calculus/Statistics
* Python - Pandas, Numpy 
* Create a functional product
* Familiarity with VSc
* Build a decision engine using real life data
* Certification (AWS, Azure, Cloudera, IBM)
* Data and Network Security

#### 12/11 Day 1 - CMD - talk to the computer and tell it what to do in a conversational style
dir - show directory\
mkdir - make a folder \
echo - back what comes next > destination.type\
type - out the text\
Ren - rename\
.. - back\
Bash and Power Shell introduction to commands
#### 12/12 Day 2 Python projects
Attempted 12 beginner [Python projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg&t=1564s) \
Made it through 4 of them - got stuck at tic tac toe, its not that beginner, she jumps between declarative and non-declarative styles w/o explaining
#### 12/14 Day 3 Automate the boring stuff with Python
My first step on this data science path is to be able to automate steps that eat time, are necessary and are administrative in nature\
Once I can automate as needed, I can progress to more advanced functions\
I will also need to understand networking and security, at least at the basics
#### 12/15 Automate the boring stuff
Finished the online videos from Al Sweigart - I now have the base to build from\
The series stopped before actually putting it to use with excel and things like that\
I have several courses in my cart at a discounted rate on udemy in addition to the conclusion of -easy stuff\
I may actually even be looking at head of and director level roles with the right play
#### 12/16 The first node in a network is made
Meet CS and talked python - I now have someone to bounce serious code...maybe Rimy also\
Refocus on Pandas\
Not much code today, work intrusion
##### 12/17 Pandas
I have a clear vision of what to create - a Watson for **employer**
I have to be careful, make sure there are locks in place to safeguard IP\
IBM data science intro\
Attempt to connect to teradata using python - locked my logon credentials (progress?)
#### 12/18 IBM Data Science
Course 1 of IBM Data Science in the books - very introductory\
Revisit 12 beginner python projects and some Pandas work\
Azure essentials to close out the day\
How do branches work? I created a branch for approval of a change to the code, the code was reviewed with a comment and adjustments made...branch merged (but not deleted)
#### 12/20 SaedSayad.com/data-mining-map.htm
This is fundamental stuff...but its great to read it in those terms and how to write/speak about these concepts\
The Azure side of cloud computing

Not much code lately :\ soon...

## BACK AT IT AGAIN

#### 12/29 Cath-up and updates
Spent a lot of time in the last week getting the base figured out - fundamentals with IBM, spent time studying those with the jobs I want looking for gaps\
The IBM data science program is a great starting point - Data Asset eXchange and Model Asset eXchange and other open data soures from gov and int'l sources, google (litterally)\
I should start to look at Julia and Seldon\
Database management is as important as the code // Couch, Cassandra, MongoDB,\
Streaming vs Batch data processing // Apache Spark/Flint, Airflow, Kubeflow, Kafka\
The space I occupy is ELT extract and load for transformation\
KNIME\
I need to deploy a tool, analysis, project

## OK FOR REAL THIS TIME

### 01/06 Prep for a screen
Refreshed and performed a Holt-winters triple-exponential forecast, manually...goal is to it using Pandas\
Recieved the new machine - spending some time acclimating to Linux
