# My 100 Days of Code

I am starting this with only self-taugh experience with SQL.

My goal is to move from a simple data analyst with the ability to query databases and onto data sscientist and product manager

I have a long list to tackle and will try to fit it all in:\
  Visualization (Tableau, Power BI)\
  Networking - connecting remotely, virtual machines, cloud computing\
  Command line\
  Python - Pandas, Numpy \
  Create a functional product\
  Familiarity with VSc\
  Build a decision engine using real life data\
  Certification (AWS, Azure, Cloudera, IBM)
